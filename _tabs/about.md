Hello, I am Shiva Sud, welcome to my website! The aim of this website is to document my future academic endeavours in Computer Science through blog posts and project summaries. To begin with I plan to implement basic machine learning algorithms, starting from linear regression. I want to implement these algorithms from scratch, only using raw python and occassionally using Numpy. I will explain the intuition behind these algorithms in my own words, to help me solidify my understanding. I will also explain all of the maths that is new to me, for example in the upcoming Linear regression document, I will explain what a partial derivative is, but not what a derivative is since I already understand the fundamentals of calculus. Happy reading :)

Need to write an article on:
* MSE vs MAE
* Gradient Descent
